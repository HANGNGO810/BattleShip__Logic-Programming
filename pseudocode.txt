1. READ the ship grid text file into a two-dimensional array named "shipMap"
2. CREATE a two-dimensional array named "targetingMap" for DISPLAYING target
3. INITIALIZE targetingMap with blank cells and indicate the index of row and column
4. SET the count for Missiles and hits
5. DISPLAY initial targetingMap
6. REPEAT until missiles count is zero OR hits count is equal or greater than 17
    6.1 PROMPT user for the input targeting value and TRY CATCH invalid value
    6.2 GET the index of Row and Column from user input value
    6.3 LOOP into the shipMap to check IF user makes a hit or a miss:
        6.3.1 IF value of shipMap at the Index of row and column is equal to 1 THEN update targetingMap with a hit value "X" AND increase hit count
        6.3.2 IF value of shipMap at the Index of row and column is equal to 0 THEN update targetingMap with a miss value "0"
    6.4 DECREASE missiles count
    6.5 DISPLAY the targetingMap and current missiles count
7. IF the hit counts is equal or greater than 17 THEN DISPLAY message "You Win!" and display the shipMap
8. IF the missile count is 0 and hit count is less than 17 THEN DISPLAY message "You lose!"
9. End program.
